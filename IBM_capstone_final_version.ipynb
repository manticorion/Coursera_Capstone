    "We notice that there are two world cuisines that returned null hits for all postal codes. We remove these columns, not just because they are insignificant, but also because as will become clear later, they might skew or distort results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then proceed to define what the target cuisine of the customer is. We calculate the total number of restaurants in the postal code, and the total number excluding our target cuisine. We also remove those postal codes that have zero restaurants. These are not numerous, but removing them is extremely important for two reasons:\n",
    "* First, they will cause divide by zero errors\n",
    "* But more importantly, these are special park and government postal codes that have distorted demographic and economic indicators with the potential to completely destroy regression and clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "We then proceed to calculate normalized metrics for each of our parameters. We dump these into a new frame df_norm. For most fields, normalization goes the same way: find maximum entry in the column, then the column becomes the old column normalized by the maximum. For the target cuisine count normalization is a little different because it is a negative indicator, please review the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is calculated on rows of restaurant counts, including the target cuisine. This is then normalized by the maximum variance. Notice that the variance method does perform normalization, but by definition, variance does not have an upper bound, to avoid having it overwhelm the other metrics, we normalize it to a maximum of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then calculate the total metric as the summation of our five parameters as well as the label. This metric has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 6. As seen, most postal codes lie at neither extreme, the least favorable being around 0.9 and the best being near 4.\n",

    "At the very end of the section we provide a cell to scatter plot the label (tcuisine) against multiple parameters. This allows us to have a preliminary idea of the correlation and dependence involved."
